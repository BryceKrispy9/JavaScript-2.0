Master Branch - Live version of application

Little/Big features are smaller branches and then merge them together so that others can pull to their local machines

To see branches
git branch

git checkout -b readme-styling (name just for example)

To change branches
git checkout (branch [master for example])

Master branch is not touched until we merge directly into it from other branches
git merge readme-styling
