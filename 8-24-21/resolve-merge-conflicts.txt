This is when me and another team member make changes to the same file

git fetch is best used when with team

git merge origin/master
(Merge conflict will happen here)

git status
(Both modified means that the remote and local files were changed and need to be fixed)

===== signs means that we brought that down

To clean up is remove the elements you don't want and delete symbols/text and then save

git status

git add .

git commit -m "Fixed merge conflicts"

git push
