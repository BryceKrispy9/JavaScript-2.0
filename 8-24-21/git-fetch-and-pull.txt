Pull - Bring down changes from master branch/auto updates the file

Fetch - Bring back changes but does not override local code (This is a cleaner way of pulling code in and giving you a step in between the merge process)

git add .

git commit -m "Added new function"

git fetch
(Diverges from master branch - git pull will merge them)

git merge origin/master
(Asks why we made the change [Don't add comment with '#'])

git push
